<h1> Camping: Accessible For Everyone
</h1>

<h2> How Do I Start?
</h2>

<p>
Do you dream of traveling to beautiful places and seeing the sights that the United States has to offer? National Parks such as the Great Smoky Mountains and Arches National Park host over 10 million visitors each year, with a total of 14,891,410,480 park visitors since 1904 (https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/visitation-numbers.htm). Public land and recreation spaces offer campgrounds, wide open land, rivers, etc??? But planning a trip like that, especially if it’s your first time, can be challenging. How are you supposed to start? How should you plan this excursion? Such a trip can feel out of reach, but camping can be more accessible--both physically and financially--than you may think.

Although expensive vacations and fancy resorts may not be within reach for most Americans, the misconception that travelling is only for the wealthy or connected is incredibly off-base. In an average year, 68% of Americans will take a summer trip. (https://newmiddleclassdad.com/how-many-vacations-does-the-average-family-take/)
2.29 billion Americans take trips within the country each year (https://www.condorferries.co.uk/us-tourism-travel-statistics). So where do they go and how can they afford it?

Follow along this website to learn more about this and become more confident in your abilities as a traveler! Throughout the site, I’ll include resources throughout that help make camping accessible to even the most novice travelers.
