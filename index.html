  Do you dream of traveling to beautiful places and seeing the sights that the United States has to offer? National Parks such as the Great Smoky Mountains and Arches National Park host
  over 10 million visitors each year, with a total of 14,891,410,480 park visitors since <a href=https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/visitation-numbers.html>1904</a>. Public land and recreation
  spaces offer campgrounds, wide open land, rivers, and so much more are available to so many travelers. But planning a trip like that, especially if it’s your first time, can be challenging. How are you supposed to start? How should
  you plan this excursion? Such a trip can feel out of reach, but camping can be more accessible--both physically and financially--than you may think.

<div class=p1>
  Although expensive vacations and fancy resorts may not be within reach for most Americans, the misconception that travelling is only for
  the wealthy or well-connected is incredibly off-base. In an average year, <a href=https://www.condorferries.co.uk/us-tourism-travel-statistics/> 68% of Americans</a> will take a summer trip.
  According to New Middle Class Dad, <a href=https://newmiddleclassdad.com/how-many-vacations-does-the-average-family-take/>2.29 billion Americans </a> take trips within the country each year.
  So where do they go and how can they afford it? </p> </div>

Follow along this website to learn more about this and become more confident in your abilities as a traveler! Throughout the site, I’ll include resources throughout that help make camping accessible
to even the most novice of travelers.
