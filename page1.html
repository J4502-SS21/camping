<h2> Where Should I Stay?
</h2>

<div class=p1>
  Deciding where to travel depends on a variety of factors: location, physical access, attractions, etc. <a href=https://www.outsideonline.com/2318861/best-national-parks-those-disabilities>These parks</a> rank high for those with disabilities or mobility issues. Once a destination is decided, you have to find where to stay.
Choosing where your group is going to sleep can be stressful. The National Parks Service offers <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/accessibility/index.htm">accessibility reports and resources</a> for campers planning ahead.

  <div class=p2>
  I've found camping on public land (like government-owned land by the <a href=https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping>Bureau of Land Management</a>) is often the cheapest way to set up your tent. Most land on state and national parks offer economical campgrounds as well. However, these plots of land are often found in more rural areas, so doing your research ahead of time to be sure you know what you're getting into is always recommended.
  <br>
  <br> Some questions to ask yourself:
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li> Is there signal or wifi available?
      <li> How far away is the nearest town?
      <li> What facilities are offered? (ie bathrooms, showerhouses, electrical hook-ups)
      <li> What does my group need to have an enjoyable time?
      <li> Where will we go if there's an emergency?
  </ul>
